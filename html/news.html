    <h2>New release (0.0.20051112) adds preliminary GUI debugger (12/11/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    The promised GUI debugger is now ready in a preliminary form (meaning that
    lots of things aren't supported yet, but it shouldn't break). There are also
    several new extensions supported (see the changelog).
    </p>
    <h2>Patch against 0.0.20050512 (18/5/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    Luca Cappa has been very helpful pointing out bugs. <a href="downloads/bugle-0.0.20050512-patch-luca1">This patch</a>
    should fix a number of compile-time problems. After applying it, be sure to
    rerun <tt>configure</tt> and do a <tt>make clean</tt>.
    </p>
    <h2>New release fixes build error (12/5/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    I've just released a new version <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bugle/bugle-0.0.20050512.tar.bz2?download">(0.0.20050512)</a> that fixes the build problem listed in the previous post. It also fixes a few bugs and adds some new extensions to the state dump in gldb, so it is worth installing even if the previous release compiled for you.
    </p>
    <h2>Read this if you have a build error (11/5/2005)</h2>
    <p>Several people have emailed me to ask about build errors like the following:
    </p>
<pre>
filters/stats.c: In function `initialise_stats':                                
filters/stats.c:408: error: `GROUP_glBeginQueryARB' undeclared (first

</pre>
    <p>
    The short answer is yes, I messed up. I'll make a bugfix release soon, but in
    meantime here are two workarounds you can try.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Update your <tt>glext.h</tt>. You can download the latest one from SGI
        <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/glext.h">here</a>. The file normally lives in /usr/include/GL/glext.h, although your OS may do something different. If you're not the sysadmin on your machine, you can put the downloaded file in a <tt>GL</tt> subdirectory of the bugle tree. Upgrading <tt>glext.h</tt>
        is a good idea anyway, since it will enable extra features of bugle.</li>
        <li>Repair the code. Either just remove the two offending lines, or else
        surround the enclosing <tt>if</tt> statement with the lines
        <kbd>#ifdef GL_ARB_occlusion_query</kbd> and <kbd>#endif</kbd></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>GUI debugger in the works (28/03/2005)</h2>
    <p>If you're wondering what's been happening since the last release, here's the answer: I've been working on a GUI version of the debugger. A big advantage over the text based debugger will be a texture viewer. There may also be a viewer for buffers (e.g. depth buffer, stencil buffer), but that might take a bit longer. You can see what the debugger looks like so far in <a href="gldb-gui.png">this</a> screenshot.
    <h2>Email address fixed (23/02/2005)</h2>
    <p>The email address that my sourceforge address forwards to disappeared
    several months ago, and I forgot to update the forward. My apologies to
    anyone who has tried to reach me. Please try again now - it should now go
    to the right address (or wait until 24/02/2005, since Sourceforge says
    it may take up to 24 hours to effect the change). A general reminder:
    bugs, support requests etc. mail to
    bmerry &lt;at] users.sourceforge (dot) net.</p>
    <h2>Version 0.0.20050221 released (21/02/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    After three months of development, the shiny new version is ready. The state
    manager has been completely rewritten, and now works much better. 
    It also supports very nearly all of the OpenGL 2.0 state. You can download it from the Sourceforge <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bugle/">project page</a>.
