The big changes are improvements to the debugging facility, gldb. Pressing
Ctrl-C will now stop the program (ala gdb), and it is possible to query
OpenGL state. Refer to the gldb(1) manual page for details.

This release also offers much better thread safety, and it should now
be mostly possible to use bugle even with programs that render
simultaneously from multiple threads. However, the debugger will not
work on a multi-threaded program, and there are still a few known race
conditions.

This release adds the gldb debugging tool. This replaces the rather
primitive debugging mode of earlier releases, where you specified
breakpoints in the config file. See the man page for instructions on
using gldb.

You will probably need to modify your configuration file, to take
account of the following changes (or you can just copy the one in
doc/examples/filters.
- The invoke filter-set is automatically loaded. You may still specify
  it, but omitting it makes no difference.
- The debugger filter-set should no longer be specified. It is
  automatically loaded by the debugger, and attempting to use it
  without the debugger will lead to errors.
- The "error" filter-set has been renamed to "showerror".
  An "error" filter-set still exists, but only detects errors for the
  benefit of other filter-sets. For example, the "log" filter-set will
  log errors if the "error" filter-set is used.

This is the first public release of BuGLe. Please read the README file
first, as the software it still pretty rough.
