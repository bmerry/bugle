This document describes the protocol used between the gldb debugger and
the libbugle library debugger filterset. As this is still alpha
software, the protocol is subject to change at any time, and there is
no guarantee that it will be possible to mix versions of gldb and
libbugle.

The protocol is a simple binary protocol. This makes it easier to use
with the read() and write() system calls, rather than using the C stdio
layer. The former are easier to use with features like select(), but
are not suitable for text-based protocols.

Values are all 32-bit except where otherwise specified. Strings are a
32-bit count followed by the characters (no explicit terminator). At
present values are not byte-ordered consistently. However, they are all
run through TO_NETWORK() and TO_HOST() so that these macros may later
map to htonl and ntohl for network transparency. 

Upon hitting any form of breakpoint or upon receiving a request from
the debugger that demands a response, the library will send a response
code and possibly extra data.

The following responses are defined (the symbols are defined in
common/protocol.h)
RESP_ANS:    A generic response, containing a single number. The request
             determines the meaning.
RESP_BREAK:  Break on a particular function (before execution). Followed
             by the name of the function.
RESP_BREAK_ERROR:
             Break on an error condition (after execution)
             Followed by the name of the function, then the (textual)
             name of the error.
RESP_STOP:   A stop by request of the debugger. No extra data.
RESP_STATE:  Response to a state request. Followed by the textual value
             of the state. DEPRECATED.
RESP_ERROR:  The request was illegal. Followed by an error code (always
             0 for now) and an error string.
RESP_RUNNING:
             Sent at initialisation, in response to REQ_START. No extra
             data. This response aids in separating the responses to
             the initialisation commands from everything else.
RESP_SCREENSHOT:
             Sent when a screenshot is requested. Contains a string in
             PPM (P6) format that can be dumped directly to file.
RESP_STATE_NODE_BEGIN
RESP_STATE_NODE_END:
             New-style state response. BEGIN is followed by the name of
             the state (empty for root state) and the textual value (empty
             if there is no associated value). This is followed by
             children in the tree (with their own BEGIN/END responses),
             and finally RESP_STATE_NODE_END, which has no parameters.

After each response group, the debugger should send a request. The
requests have the same basic form. The following requests are defined:

REQ_RUN:     Start running. This is sent once at start-up, after setting
             the initial breakpoints and similar state.
REQ_CONT:    Continue running
REQ_STEP:    Like REQ_CONT, but stop at the next call. Note that if a
             breakpoint is set on the next call, the response is
             RESP_BREAK, and if an error occurs before reaching the next
             call then the response is RESP_BREAK_ERROR.
REQ_BREAK:   Set or clear a breakpoint on the named function.
             Followed by a name then either 1 or 0 (for set/clear).
             Response RESP_ANS has undefined value.
REQ_BREAK_ERROR: 
             Enable or disable breaking on error. Followed by either
             1 or 0 (for set/clear). Response RESP_ANS has undefined value.
REQ_ASYNC:   Requests the program to stop at the next available point.
             This is the only request that may be made asynchronously
             i.e. when the program is not inside the debugger loop. To
             facilitate correct operation in the face of race conditions,
             this request is ignored if received inside the debugger loop.
             Otherwise it is answered with RESP_
REQ_STATE:   Requests the value of a state. Followed by the name of
             the state. DEPRECATED.
REQ_SCREENSHOT: Requests a screenshot from the program. Reply is
             RESP_SCREENSHOT on success, or RESP_ERROR if the screenshot
             could not be taken for some reason.
REQ_QUIT:    Requests that the program exit.
REQ_STATE_STATE: Requests the state tree. No parameters.

Each request has a certain set of legal responses, as described below.
Note that requests that start the program running (the first three) may
also return RESP_STOP if a REQ_ASYNC was received.

REQ_RUN:   RESP_RUNNING, followed by a code as for REQ_CONT
REQ_CONT:  RESP_BREAK, RESP_BREAK_ERROR
REQ_STEP:  RESP_BREAK, RESP_BREAK_ERROR, RESP_STOP
REQ_BREAK: RESP_ANS, RESP_ERROR
REQ_BREAK_ERROR: RESP_ANS
REQ_ASYNC: REQ_STOP, or nothing (see description)
REQ_STATE: RESP_STATE, RESP_ERROR
REQ_SCREENSHOT: RESP_SCREENSHOT, RESP_ERROR.
REQ_STATE: RESP_STATE_BEGIN, RESP_STATE_END.
REQ_QUIT:  none (program exits)
